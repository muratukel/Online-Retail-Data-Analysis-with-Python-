## ðŸ‘€ INFORMATION & FEATURES ABOUT THE DATASET

The Online Retail dataset is a source of real transaction data, with a specific focus on e-commerce operations. Such datasets are often private, making it challenging to find publicly available data; however, the UCI Machine Learning Repository has curated this dataset under the title 'Online Retail' to encompass genuine transactions. The dataset comprises various columns, including 'StockCode,' which represents distinct 5-digit product codes, 'Quantity,' denoting the quantity of each product per transaction, 'InvoiceDate,' indicating the date and time of each transaction, 'UnitPrice,' reflecting the product's price per unit in pounds sterling, 'CustomerID,' a unique 5-digit identifier assigned to individual customers, and 'Country,' representing the name of the country where each customer resides.

The 6-digit 'InvoiceNo' uniquely identifies each transaction, with transactions starting with the letter 'c' signifying cancellations. Additionally, the 5-digit 'StockCode' uniquely identifies different products, while the 'Description' column provides insights into the names of these products. The numerical 'Quantity' column represents the quantity of each product in a transaction, and the 'UnitPrice' column represents the price per unit of the product. The 'CustomerID' uniquely identifies each customer, and the 'Country' column specifies the country of residence for each customer, enabling the attribution of transactions to different customers and geographical locations.

This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in understanding e-commerce transactions, customer behaviors, trend analysis, demand forecasting, and more."
